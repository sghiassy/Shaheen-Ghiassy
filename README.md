## Blurb

I'm currently the Mobile Architect at Groupon. In previous roles, I've also been

- React Native (iOS/Android) Tech Lead
- iOS (native) Software Engineer
- Engineering Manager
- Full-Stack Programmer
- Front-end Web Engineer
- UIUX/Graphic Design

In addition to my professional life, I also enjoy

- Backpacking
- Skydiving
- Programming (yes, I'm really that much of a nerd)

I used to maintain a custom website that would showcase my front-end skills, but after taking on so many engineering projects professionally was never able to keep it up date and it no longer represetned my best work. For the curious, you can still visit it at [shaheenghiassy.herokuapp.com](http://shaheenghiassy.herokuapp.com/).
